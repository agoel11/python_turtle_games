# python_turtle_games
Games made with python using the turtle module

These games are made using these tutorials:
Snake game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP7KMlbvtOo&list=PLlEgNdBJEO-n8k9SR49AshB9j7b5Iw7hZ - video 1 in a playlist
Pong game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w - single video

THESE GAMES AND CODE ARE NOT MY CREATION! THEY ARE CREDITED TO CHRISTIAN THOMPSON FROM THE VIDEOS ABOVE.

These games use the turtle module and are made using python 3

You can adjust colors and shapes however you want

The code is intermediate level and is not machine specific (can be used on MAC, Linux, or Windows)

Enjoy!
