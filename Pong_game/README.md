Games made with python using the turtle module

This game is made using this tutorial

THIS GAME AND CODE ARE NOT MY CREATION! IT IS CREDITED TO CHRISTIAN THOMPSON FROM THE VIDEO ABOVE.

This game uses the turtle module and is made using python 3

You can adjust colors and shapes however you want

The code is intermediate level and is not machine specific (can be used on MAC, Linux, or Windows)

There is some bug with the gravity/ motion/ speed of the ball that I did not know how to fix. Sorry. If you find the solution let me know!

Player on the right is controlled by arrow keys

Player on the left is controlled by WASD keys

I apologize for the lack of comments, this code is quite old

Enjoy!
